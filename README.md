    someone.
  - **🙏 `Acknowledgments.tex`**: Contains acknowledgments for
    contributions and support received.
  - **📝 `PersianAbstract.tex`**: Includes the Persian abstract
    summarizing the research work.
  - **📖 `Chapter1.tex`** to **`Chapter6.tex`**: Each file represents a
    chapter of the thesis, facilitating easier management of the
    document.
  - **📚 `Reference.bib`**: A BibTeX file with all the references cited

### 🖋️ `Fonts/`

This directory includes font files used in the document.

  - **🗂️ \[Font Files\]**: Contains font files (.ttf, .otf, etc.) used
    for specific typographic needs or to maintain consistency with
    departmental formatting guidelines. These fonts are loaded and
    applied through LaTeX configuration files.

### 🖼️ `Pictures/`

This directory is used for storing image files included in the thesis.

  - **🖼️ \[Image Files\]**: Contains images, figures, and diagrams
    referenced in the thesis. Supported formats may include .png, .jpg,

    commands and can be placed within chapters, appendices, or other
    sections as needed.

### 📝 Instructions

  - **🔧 Adding Packages**: If you need to add or update LaTeX packages,
    modify the `Packages.tex` file in the `SetupFiles` directory. This
    will ensure that the new packages are included in the document.

  - **✏️ Writing Document Content**: For writing and editing the content
    of your thesis, use the files in the `TexFiles` directory. Each file
    corresponds to a different section or chapter of the thesis.

  - **🛠️ Compiling the Document**: To compile the thesis, run the
    `Main.tex` file. This will integrate all the sections and
    configurations into a single document.

  - **🖥️ Compiling with LaTeX Editors**:
    
      - **💻 Overleaf**: You should not encounter any issues with
        Overleaf; it handles compilation automatically. However, to
        ensure proper handling of Persian text and other features, make
        sure to set Overleaf's compiler to **XeLaTeX**. You can do this
        by navigating to the "Menu" in Overleaf, selecting "Settings,"
        and then choosing **XeLaTeX** as the default compiler.
    
      - **🖥️ Local LaTeX Installation**: If you are using a LaTeX editor
        installed on your local machine (e.g., TeXMaker, TeXstudio), you
        need to use the following command for
        compiling:
        
        ``` shell
        xelatex.exe -shell-escape -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex
        ```
        
        This command ensures that XeLaTeX is used with the necessary
        options to handle Persian text and other features correctly.

Feel free to adjust the instructions based on your specific needs and
preferences. If you have any further questions or need additional help,
